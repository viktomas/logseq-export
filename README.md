# logseq-export

Tool to export raw [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq) Markdown files (with `public::` page property) into Markdown blog posts with front matter.

- Takes Logseq page properties (`title:: Hello world`) and turns them into [Front Matter properties](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) `title: Hello World`.
- Changes the Markdown syntax to remove the top-level bullet points.

## Install

- Download the latest binary for your OS in the [Releases](https://github.com/viktomas/logseq-export/releases) page
- `go install github.com/viktomas/logseq-export@latest` if you have Go installed

## Usage

### Command

```
logseq-export
  -blogFolder string
        [MANDATORY] Folder where all public pages are exported.
  -graphPath string
        [MANDATORY] Path to the root of your logseq graph containing /pages and /journals directories.
  -assetsRelativePath
        relative path within blogFolder where the assets (images) should be stored (e.g. 'static/images/logseq'). Default is logseq-images (default "logseq-images")
  -webAssetsPathPrefix
    	  path that the images are going to be served on on the web (e.g. '/public/images/logseq'). Default is /logseq-images (default "/logseq-images")
  -unquotedProperties string
        comma-separated list of logseq page properties that won't be quoted in the markdown frontmatter, e.g. 'date,public,slug'
```

#### Command example

This is how I run the command on my machine:

```sh
logseq-export \
  --graphPath /Users/tomas/workspace/private/notes \
  --blogFolder /Users/tomas/workspace/private/blog \
  --unquotedProperties date,slug,public,tags \
  --assetsRelativePath static/images/logseq \
  --webAssetsPathPrefix /images/logseq
```

This will take my logseq notes and copies them to blog, it will also copy all the images to `/Users/tomas/workspace/private/blog/static/images/logseq`, but the image links themselves are going to have `/images/logseq` prefix (`![alt](/images/logseq/image.png)`).

### Logseq page properties with a special meaning (all optional)

- `public` - as soon as this page property is present (regardless of value), the page gets exported
- `slug` used as a file name
- `date` it's used as a file name prefix
- `folder` the page is going to be exported in this subfolder e.g. `content/posts`
  - the `folder` property always uses `/` (forward slash) but on Windows, it gets translated to `\` in folder path
  - if the base export folder is `a` and the `folder` page property is `b/c`, then the resulting page will be in `a/b/c` folder
